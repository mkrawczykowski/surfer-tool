# How to test this tool?

Copy the data from this file (it's a data from Surfer SEO, a tool for SEO experts):
<br><br>
https://stronyireszta.pl/portfolio/surfer-tool/example-data.txt
<br><br>
Each list item shows what phrase you should use in your text and how many times.
<br><br><br><br>

...and then paste it to the first textarea here: https://stronyireszta.pl/portfolio/surfer-tool/
<br><br>
The orange list items will appear. Notice that each of them has three types of information inside:
- a phrase
- a number of times this phrase has already been used in text
- a range that tells us how many timet a phrase should be used in text.
<br><br>
When you use a phrase a recommended number of times, the list item will turn green. If you use a phrase too many times, the list item will turn red.
<br><br>
Example:<br>
Paste the below string to the bottom textarea:
<br><br>
informacje informacje informacje informacje
<br><br>
(yes, it's four times the same word). 
<br><br>
You should now see how one of the list items became green as we met it's conditions: 4-13.
